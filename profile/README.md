## Mission
**Advancing brain tumor care through collaborative AI and open science.**

Since 2012, BraTS has set the standard for brain tumor image analysis, driving progress by:
- Benchmarking innovative algorithms
- Providing high-quality, annotated datasets
- Fostering solutions to real clinical challenges

## BraTS 2025 Lighthouse Challenge
In partnership with leading organizations (such as AI-RANO, RSNA, ASNR, NIH, FDA, ASFNR, CBTN), BraTS 2025 expands its focus to:
- Longitudinal assessment of tumor response
- Generalizability of segmentation methods
- Inclusion of rare tumor entities with limited annotations
- Missing MRI (global) synthesis and inpainting (local synthesis)
